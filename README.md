# Implementing-Classification-Tree
Implementing classification trees, evaluating their accuracy and Pruning Techniques implementation  without using libraries

a) Implement the greedy algorithm that learns a classification tree given a data set. Assume
that all features are numerical and properly find the best threshold for each split. Use Gini and
information gain, as specified by user, to decide on the best attribute to split in every step. Stop
growing the tree when all examples in a node belong to the same class or the remaining examples
contain identical features.

b) Implement 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the accuracy of your algorithm on breast cancer dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic).
<br>
c) Modify your decision tree from the previous question and evaluate the overfitting
prevention methods listed below. All evaluation should be carried out using 10-fold cross-validation as
implemented in the previous Problem, but the performance should be evaluated using multiple measures.
Use ‘pessimistic’ estimates of the generalization error by adding a penalty factor 0.5 for each
node in the tree
<br>
d) Use the minimum description length principle
